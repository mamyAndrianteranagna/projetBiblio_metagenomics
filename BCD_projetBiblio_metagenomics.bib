abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.
Results: To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use ‘spaced words’, defined by patterns of ‘match’ and ‘don’t care’ positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.

@article{Veyrieras2015,
abstract = {Metagenomics characterizes the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities by sequencing DNA directly from an environmental sample. One of the main challenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each sequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Due to the large volume of metagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that can operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard alignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional approaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it contains have the potential to provide faster solutions. In this work, we investigate the potential of modern, large-scale machine learning implementations for taxonomic affectation of next-generation sequencing reads based on their k-mers profile. We show that machine learning-based compositional approaches benefit from increasing the number of fragments sampled from reference genome to tune their parameters, up to a coverage of about 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning these models involves training a machine learning model on about 10 8 samples in 10 7 dimensions, which is out of reach of standard soft-wares but can be done efficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The resulting models are competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established alignment tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate species, and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however, that compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with problems involving a greater number of species, and more sensitive to sequencing errors. We finally confirm that compositional approach achieve faster prediction times, with a gain of 3 to 15 times with respect to the BWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the level of sequencing noise.},

The exploding genomic data growth presents a dilemma for DNA homology search techniques: increasing seed size decreases sensitivity whereas decreasing seed size slows down computation. RESULTS: We present a new homology search algorithm 'PatternHunter' that uses a novel seed model for increased sensitivity and new hit-processing techniques for significantly increased speed. At Blast levels of sensitivity, PatternHunter is able to find homologies between sequences as large as human chromosomes, in mere hours on a desktop.

abstract = {Soil bacterium DNA was isolated by minor modifications of previously described methods. After purification on hydroxyapatite and precipitation with cetylpyridinium bromide, the DNA was sheared in a French press to give fragments with an average molecular mass of 420,000 daltons. After repeated hydroxyapatite purification and precipitation with cetylpyridinium bromide, high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed the presence of 2.1{\%} RNA or less, whereas 5-methylcytosine made up 2.9{\%} of the total deoxycytidine content. No other unusual bases could be detected. The hyperchromicity was 31 to 36{\%}, and the melting curve in lx SSC (0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) corresponded to 58.3 mol{\%} G+C. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of two DNA samples gave 58.6 and 60.8 mol{\%} G+C. The heterogeneity of the DNA was determined by reassociation of single-stranded DNA, measured spectrophotometrically. Owing to the high complexity of the DNA, the reassociation had to be carried out in 6x SSC with 30{\%} dimethyl sulfoxide added. Cuvettes with a 1-mm light path were used, and the A275 was read. DNA concentrations as high as 950 ,ug ml-1 could be used, and the reassociation rate of Escherichia coli DNA was increased about 4.3-fold compared with standard conditions. C0t412 values were determined relative to that for E. coli DNA, whereas calf thymus DNA was reassociated for comparison. Our results show that the major part of DNA isolated from the bacterial fraction of soil is very heterogeneous, with a Cot,12 about 4,600, corresponding to about 4,000 completely different genomes of standard soil bacteria. The reassociation curves did not follow ideal second-order reaction curves, indicating that there are several different DNA fractions corresponding to common and more rare biotypes. This means that the C0t412 values give only approximate and probably low values for the genome number. Some of the DNA preparations had a rapidly reassociating fraction of about 5{\%} of the total DNA. The reassociation rate for this fraction was about one-third of the rate of the E. coli genome. The fraction might be a population of plasmids and/or bacteriophages. Our results indicate that the diversity of the total bacterial community in a deciduous-forest soil is so high that diversity indices based on DNA heterogeneity can be determined only with difficulty. Most of the diversity is located in that part of the community which cannot be isolated and cultured by standard techniques.},

abstract = {The phylogenetic diversity of an oligotrophic marine picoplankton community was examined by analyzing the sequences of cloned ribosomal genes. This strategy does not rely on cultivation of the resident microorganisms. Bulk genomic DNA was isolated from picoplankton collected in the north central Pacific Ocean by tangential flow filtration. The mixed-population DNA was fragmented, size fractionated, and cloned into bacteriophage lambda. Thirty-eight clones containing 16S rRNA genes were identified in a screen of 3.2 x 10(4) recombinant phage, and portions of the rRNA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The resulting sequences were used to establish the identities of the picoplankton by comparison with an established data base of rRNA sequences. Fifteen unique eubacterial sequences were obtained, including four from cyanobacteria and eleven from proteobacteria. A single eucaryote related to dinoflagellates was identified; no archaebacterial sequences were detected. The cyanobacterial sequences are all closely related to sequences from cultivated marine Synechococcus strains and with cyanobacterial sequences obtained from the Atlantic Ocean (Sargasso Sea). Several sequences were related to common marine isolates of the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. In addition to sequences closely related to those of described bacteria, sequences were obtained from two phylogenetic groups of organisms that are not closely related to any known rRNA sequences from cultivated organisms. Both of these novel phylogenetic clusters are proteobacteria, one group within the alpha subdivision and the other distinct from known proteobacterial subdivisions. The rRNA sequences of the alpha-related group are nearly identical to those of some Sargasso Sea picoplankton, suggesting a global distribution of these organisms.},

abstract = {The high-throughput metagenomic sequencing offers a powerful technique to compare the microbial communities. Without requiring extra reference sequences, alignment-free models with short k-tuple (k=2-10bp) yielded promising results. Short k-tuples describe the overall statistical distribution, but is hard to capture the specific characteristics inside one microbial community. Longer k-tuple contains more abundant information. However, because the frequency vector of long k-tuple(k≥30bp) is sparse, the statistical measures designed for short k-tuples are not applicable. In our study, we considered each tuple as a meaningful word and then each sequencing data as a document composed of the words. Therefore, the comparison between two sequencing data is processed as "topic analysis of documents" in text mining. We designed a pipeline with long k-tuple features to compare metagenomic samples combined using algorithms from text mining and pattern recognition. The pipeline is available at http://culotuple.codeplex.com/. Experiments show that our pipeline with long k-tuple features: ①separates genomes with high similarity; ②outperforms short k-tuple models in all experiments. When k≥12, the short k-tuple measures are not applicable anymore. When k is between 20-40, long k-tuple pipeline obtains much better grouping results; ③is free from the effect of sequencing platforms/protocols. ③We obtained meaningful and supported biological results on the 40-tuples selected for comparison.},
